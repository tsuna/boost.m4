	* tests/testsuite.at: Test the new macro.

2008-01-11  Benoit Sigoure  <tsuna@lrde.epita.fr>

	Handle the `gcc' tag used by newer versions of Boost.
	* build-aux/boost.m4 (_BOOST_FIND_COMPILER_TAG): When the compiler
	is gcc also try the `gcc' tag (after the version-specific tag e.g.
	`gcc41') since newer versions of Boost (>= 1.35?) seem to do that.
	Report and patch by Daniel Herring.

2008-01-11  Benoit Sigoure  <tsuna@lrde.epita.fr>

	Handle multiple versions of Boost under the same prefix.
	* build-aux/boost.m4 (BOOST_REQUIRE): Find the headers of all the
	versions of Boost installed.  If you have, say,
	/usr/local/include/boost which is a symlink to
	/usr/local/include/boost-1_34 and you also have
	/usr/local/include/boost-1_35 installed, the macro needs to find
	them all if you required Boost 1.35 for instance.
	Bug reported by Daniel Herring.

2008-01-07  Benoit Sigoure  <tsuna@lrde.epita.fr>

	Fix the test for Boost.Test.
	Some extra code is required to use Boost.Test which defines its own
	`main' function.
	* build-aux/boost.m4 (BOOST_FIND_LIB): Accept a 5th optional
	argument.
	(BOOST_TEST): Use it to define `init_unit_test_suite'.

	BOOST_TEST.
	* THANKS: Update.
	Problem reported by Jens Seidel.  Patch contributed by Hubert
	Figuière.

	* build-aux/boost.m4 (BOOST_REQUIRE): Mention explicitely that
	VERSION can be of the form "X.Y.Z".
	Report by Jens Seidel.

2007-12-03  Benoit Sigoure  <tsuna@lrde.epita.fr>

	Do not depend on Autoconf 2.61.
	AS_TEST_X was introduced in 2.61.  Alas, 2.60 is still common out
	there, so let's use $as_executable_p instead.
	* THANKS: Update.
	* build-aux/boost.m4 (_BOOST_AC_LINK_IFELSE): Here.
	Report by Jens Seidel.

	Improve the portability of BOOST_FILESYSTEM.
	* build-aux/boost.m4: Do not check for boost/filesystem.hpp as it
	was introduced in 1.34.  Check for boost/filesystem/path.hpp
	instead.
	Report by Staffan Gimåker.

2007-11-21  Benoit Sigoure  <tsuna@lrde.epita.fr>

	* build-aux/boost.m4 (BOOST_REQUIRE): Properly compute the various
	parts of the version (major, minor, sub-minor) from the
	BOOST_VERSION macro defined in version.hpp.
	Bug reported by Staffan Gimåker.

	Fix typos.
	* build-aux/boost.m4: Correct various tyops everywhere.

2007-11-20  Benoit Sigoure  <tsuna@lrde.epita.fr>

	Check that version.hpp exists before trying an include path.
	* build-aux/boost.m4 (BOOST_REQUIRE): Here.  This ensures that we
	don't get the include path wrong *but* the test succeeds because
	Boost is reachable thanks to the default include path of the
	compiler.  Bug reported by Staffan Gimåker.

2007-11-20  Benoit Sigoure  <tsuna@lrde.epita.fr>

	Re-order the macros.
	* build-aux/boost.m4: Sort the macros alphabetically (yes, `T' is

	* tests/testsuite.at: Test the new macros.

2007-11-20  Benoit Sigoure  <tsuna@lrde.epita.fr>

	Aggressively optimize the checks against Boost libraries.
	Checking for Boost libraries that require linking was very slow
	because it took several iteration to discover the proper link flags
	to use to properly compile+link a C++ test file.  The test file was
	thus compiled over and over again until the right set of flag is
	found.  Compilation is time-consuming, especially with Boost, so the
	trick is to compile the file once and then try to link it.
	Unfortunately, Autoconf doesn't seem to allow this and always wants
	to delete the intermediate object file.  This file thus bypasses one
	of the Autoconf internal macro to retain the object file.
	On a test case which checks for 2 libraries, the configure time is
	reduced by a factor of 5 on my laptop (~100s -> ~20s).
	* build-aux/boost.m4 (BOOST_FIND_LIB): Compile the test file once
	and then try to link it.
	(_BOOST_AC_LINK_IFELSE): Fork of the Autoconf macro _AC_LINK_IFELSE.
	Optimization suggested by Daniel Herring.

2007-11-20  Benoit Sigoure  <tsuna@lrde.epita.fr>

	Optimize the detection of preference for MT flavors.
	* build-aux/boost.m4 (BOOST_FIND_LIB): Move a compilation test...
	(_BOOST_GUESS_WHETHER_TO_USE_MT): Here.  So that the test is only
	executed once per configure script.

2007-11-20  Benoit Sigoure  <tsuna@lrde.epita.fr>

	Fix the test of Boost.Graph.
	* build-aux/boost.m4 (BOOST_GRAPH): Fix the C++ code used to test
	the library.

2007-11-20  Benoit Sigoure  <tsuna@lrde.epita.fr>

	Do not pollute the user-reserved variables.
	* build-aux/boost.m4 (BOOST_FIND_LIB): Fix a bug: when a library was
	found, the LDFLAGS and LIBS weren't properly reset and the macro was
	thus polluting user-reserved variables.  This needs to be tested in
	the testsuite.
	Also do not pass -R to the compiler during the tests, this flag is
	only usable safely with libtool.

2007-11-17  Benoit Sigoure  <tsuna@lrde.epita.fr>

	Fix a typo in BOOST_THREADS.
	* build-aux/boost.m4 (BOOST_THREADS): Properly set
	`boost_threads_save_CPPFLAGS' to `CPPFLAGS' instead of `LIBS'!
	Bug reported by Daniel Herring.

2007-11-13  Benoit Sigoure  <tsuna@lrde.epita.fr>

	Preserve the original values of --host / --build.

	($build_alias, $host_alias): ... these.  New.
	* tests/testsuite.at (AT_CHECK_AUTOCONF): Use them here.

2007-11-12  Benoit Sigoure  <tsuna@lrde.epita.fr>

	argument in 2nd position (minor backward incompatible change) to
	specify keywords for the tests.
	Use keywords for all tests (core/lib/header with or without cross).

2007-11-03  Benoit Sigoure  <tsuna@lrde.epita.fr>

	Use Libtool and -R to encode run paths.
	* README: Mention the dependencies more clearly near the beginning.
	Add a step to use Libtool if it's not already used.
	* build-aux/boost.m4 (BOOST_FIND_LIB): Add -R flags in the LDFLAGS
	and fix a bug when --with-boost isn't used which leads to
	$with_boost being empty which leads that /lib is checked first.
	* configure.ac: Invoke AC_PROG_LIBTOOL.
	* tests/testsuite.at (AT_CONFIGURE_AC): Import the content of
	aclocal.m4 without the m4_include's in order to use AC_PROG_LIBTOOL
	without getting the hassle of libtoolize.
	(AT_CHECK_MACRO): Do not pass -W obsolete to autoconf to avoid
	spurious warnings due to Libtool.

2007-11-02  Benoit Sigoure  <tsuna@lrde.epita.fr>

	Another fix for GCC3 and Boost.Thread.
	* build-aux/boost.m4 (BOOST_THREADS): Put -pthread in
	BOOST_CPPFLAGS (required for GCC3).

2007-11-02  Benoit Sigoure  <tsuna@lrde.epita.fr>

	Change the order of the tests.
	* tests/testsuite.at: Do the tests that require linking first
	(because they are more likely to fail).

2007-11-02  Benoit Sigoure  <tsuna@lrde.epita.fr>

	Add tests for SmartPtr, StringAlgo, Tribool and Tuple.

	(BOOST_THREADS): Use it.  Use the pthread flag during the tests for
	Boost.Thread.
	* tests/testsuite.at: Since the test for Boost.Thread is now more
	costly, do the cross-compilation test with Boost.Filesystem instead.

	* tests/package.m4.in: New.
	* tests/testsuite.at: Invoke configure with the proper flags (that
